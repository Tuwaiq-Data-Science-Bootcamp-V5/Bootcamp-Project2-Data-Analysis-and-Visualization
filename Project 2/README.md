# Introduction

The dataset at hand comprises 119,390 observations related to hotel bookings, including both City Hotel and Resort Hotel reservations. These observations represent bookings made between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017, encompassing both successful arrivals and cancellations. It is important to note that all data elements related to hotel or customer identification have been deliberately removed to ensure privacy.

In addition to the original dataset, four columns, namely 'name,' 'email,' 'phone number,' and 'credit_card,' have been artificially generated and appended to the dataset. These columns are not representative of real customer information but have been included for the purpose of analysis.

## Problem

The dataset presents a valuable opportunity to analyze and gain insights into hotel bookings and the factors influencing them. By examining the provided data, we can explore various aspects of the booking process, such as booking patterns, customer preferences, and potential predictors of reservation cancellations. This analysis can help hotel management and stakeholders make informed decisions, enhance customer experiences, and optimize hotel operations.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of analyzing this dataset are as follows:

1. Booking Patterns: Investigate the temporal patterns of hotel bookings, including the distribution of bookings across different months, days of the week, and times of the day. This analysis can provide insights into seasonal variations, peak booking periods, and possible factors driving reservation trends.

2. Customer Preferences: Examine customer preferences in terms of hotel type (City Hotel or Resort Hotel), length of stay, and room types. This analysis can shed light on the characteristics and expectations of different types of guests and guide marketing and service strategies accordingly.

3. Cancellation Analysis: Explore the factors influencing reservation cancellations, such as lead time, previous cancellations, and booking channel. By understanding the reasons behind cancellations, hotels can implement measures to reduce cancellations, optimize revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Describe the final ten insights

### Figure One

 2. There is strong corrlation between stays and stays in weekend
 3. There is corrlation between Booking not canceld and repeated guest


### Figure Seven
1. Transient people have the majority of percentage
 2. The group has the least distribution

### Figure Eight
 -  Average Daily Rate is positive skewed that means mean is higher than median.

### Figure Nine
- The Density of people that didnt cancel are higher than people who cancel
