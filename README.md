## Introduction
In this project, we conducted an analysis of the FIFA 21 dataset to gain insights into the world of football. Our primary objectives were to explore the dataset, uncover valuable information, and provide meaningful insights for football enthusiasts, analysts, and stakeholders.

## Dataset Overview and Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset provides detailed information about FIFA 21, including player attributes, team data, and match statistics. You can find the dataset at the following source:

## Ten Insights

### 1. Scatter Plot of Release Clause vs Value
We created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between player release clauses and their market values. This insight helps assess how clubs value their players and whether release clauses are indicative of a player's true market worth.

### 2. Age Distribution Histogram
We generated a histogram to illustrate the age distribution of FIFA 21 players. This allows us to understand the distribution of players across different age groups and identify trends in player demographics.

### 3. Scatter Plot of Age vs Value
We plotted a scatter graph to explore the correlation between a player's age and their market value. This analysis can reveal how age impacts a player's market value and is crucial for assessing player potential.

### 4. Bar Chart of the Top 10 Clubs with the Highest Valued Squads
We ranked and presented the top 10 clubs with the highest squad values. This chart offers a quick reference to clubs with the most valuable rosters, providing insights into their financial strength.

### 5. Heatmap of the Dataset
We generated a heatmap to visualize the correlations and relationships between various attributes in the FIFA 21 dataset. This insight helps identify patterns and dependencies among the data.

### 6. Nationality Map using Plotly
Using Plotly, we created an interactive map that displays the distribution of players based on their nationalities. This dynamic visualization allows users to explore the diversity of nationalities within the dataset.

### 7. Top Ten Longest Player Contracts
We compiled a list of the top ten players with the longest contracts in FIFA 21. This insight showcases the commitment between clubs and players, highlighting the players with the most extended contractual obligations.

### 8. Scatter Correlation between Height and Balance
We examined the relationship between a player's height and their balance attributes using a scatter plot. This analysis helps determine if there's a correlation between these factors, which could be relevant for player performance.

### 9. Pie Chart of the nationalities distrubtuion of the top 10 nationalities
We plotted the distrubution of the top 10 nationalities in a pie chart.

### 10. Box plot Age Distribution by Skill Move
Using Seaborn, we created a box plot that visualizes the distribution of the "Age" feature with "SM" (skill movement). The SM feature contains a set of data (1 to 5) that evaluates players' skills according to their ages.

Please refer to our Jupyter Notebook for detailed code, visualizations, and statistical analysis related to these insights. We hope this analysis provides valuable information for football enthusiasts and professionals.
